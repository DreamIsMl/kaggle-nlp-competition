# Kaggle NLP Competition Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for our Natural Language Processing (NLP) project, developed for a Kaggle competition. The goal of this competition is [provide a brief description of the competition goal and any specific tasks or challenges involved].


## Project Structure

- **data**: Placeholder for dataset(s)
  - `train.csv`
  - `test.csv`
  - ...

- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
  - `data_exploration.ipynb`
  - `model_training.ipynb`
  - ...

- **src**: Source code for the project
  - `preprocessing.py`: Code for data preprocessing
  - `feature_engineering.py`: Code for feature engineering
  - `model.py`: Implementation of the NLP model
  - ...

- **utils**: Utility scripts and functions
  - `helpers.py`: Helper functions
  - `evaluation.py`: Evaluation metrics
  - ...

- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the project
- `config.yaml`: Configuration file for hyperparameters and settings
- `README.md`: Project README file

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Project Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/DreamIsMl/kaggle-nlp-competition.git`

### Data

Download the competition dataset and place the files in the `data/` directory.

### Running the Code

1. Execute the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for data exploration and model training.
2. Modify hyperparameters and settings in `config.yaml` as needed.
3. Run the main script: `python src/main.py`
